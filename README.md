# WC-Auth
Basic PAP Tracking Flask Appliciation for Winter Coalition PAP backend.

Authentication handles all scopes through the login endpoint and this will be expanded into a redevelopment of the ESI viewing tool.

FleetTrack.py is the current "Frontend" which is being moved over to a webpage.
The end goal is to provide a simple, but appealing fleet viewer where people can view their paps.
PAPs include fc_name, pap_type, and fleet_members alongside their time in fleet, ships, and systems.

Alongside this a tool is in production to automate pointing out outliers and tying this into flagging mumble-concurrence alongside ingame fleet attendance.

Secret Keys, etc. used in this are test applications and obviously do not represent the productive environment.
